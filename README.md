# SoulLink
A mod that lets you share your pain in Dark Souls


# Installation

- Install Python
- Run the downloaded exe.


# Usage

A server must be hosted by someone: Can be done easily by clicking the "Host Server"
button. Once a server is alive, and you are able to control your character
in Dark Souls, then you should be able to connect without a problem. If you're on
the title screen, there may be issues, so only connect once you have
control of your character.

The server should be able to handle disconnects without an issue; If you suspect
an issue server side, just click "Kill Server" if you are hosting, and restart
the server.

Currently only Supports DS1, maybe support other games in the future.
